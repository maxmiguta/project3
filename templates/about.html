Our partners are some of the world's leading suppliers in AV communication, such as Sony, 3M, Bose and AMX. We also have a small team of experts who possess a wealth of technical knowledge and experience - they are fully qualified to offer comprehensive advice in relation to the best products that will fulfill your specific AV requirements, whatever those may be.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we offer an equipment <dfn>installation service</dfn> specially aimed at our business customers, who typically require a more comprehensive AV solution when purchasing an array of products. This service is provided on a case by case basis and the customer will need to get in touch directly with our team to discuss their requirements.</p>
